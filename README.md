## 📖 About This Application

The **emotion-adaptive-multimodal-cbt-assistant** is a smart helper designed to recognize your emotions using your voice, facial expressions, and text messages. It uses advanced machine learning to understand how you feel and gives responses inspired by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This helps you explore your thoughts and feelings in a guided way.

This assistant combines three types of data — what you say (text), how you say it (audio), and how you look (video) — to get a clearer picture of your emotional state. It then adapts its advice or support accordingly. This makes the experience more personal and effective.

You do not need any technical skills to use it. Follow the steps below to get started.
